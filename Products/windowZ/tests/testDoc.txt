This is a sample for a doctest file
Here you can simply write python expressions
and compare the output results like this:

>>> i=1
>>> print i
1

Lets import the necessary modules
>>> from Products.windowZ import config

>>> from Products.windowZ.interfaces import IWindow
>>> from Products.windowZ.content.Window import Window

every line that starts with '>>>' will be interpreted
as python statement.
By writing the expected output after the python
prompt lines you can compare that with the result
from the above python statements. If the outputs
differ you the test fails.

You can also instanciate your classes that you want
to test like this:

>>> res=self.folder.invokeFactory('Window','myobj')
>>> print self.folder.myobj.getId()
myobj

Now you can continue with the further tests of your classes here
