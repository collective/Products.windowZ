windowZ TODO

 * Migrate the model from Poseidon to ArgoUML

 * Provide a way to change page links (javascript yet implemented on
   CMFDisplayPage) to open inside the iFrame, in the current browser or in a new
   window

 * Automatic resize of page height (it's very difficult because javascript cross
   site scripting protection)

 * Provide iFrame for portlets

 * Show security icon in the browser bottom if the pointed page uses https

 * More translations, yes, we need your help! ;-)
